  THE STORY
================================================================================
  Most eBay sellers price by gut feeling. This report reveals just how wildly
  off those instincts often are.

  When the EXACT SAME CARD (same name, same treatment) sells for $20 one day
  and $200 the next, someone is badly mispricing. Either the $20 seller left
  $180 on the table, or the $200 buyer got fleeced.

  This analysis compares sales of IDENTICAL single cards to each other -
  same card name + same treatment (e.g., 'Moonfire Crystal Mouse Formless
  Foil' vs other 'Moonfire Crystal Mouse Formless Foil' sales only).

  NOTE: Sealed product (boxes, packs, bundles) excluded - too much variance
  in quantity and contents to make fair comparisons.

  KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

  1. GUT PRICING IS WILDLY INCONSISTENT
     The same item regularly sells for 67% different prices.
     54 items had sales ranging from X to 2X or more.

  2. REAL MONEY IS BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE
     138 sellers underpriced by 30%+ = $3,364.74 lost.

  3. BUYERS ARE OVERPAYING
     96 buyers paid 50%+ over median = $5,557.43 extra.

  4. DATA BEATS GUT FEELING
     Check recent sold prices before listing. Check median before buying.
     The spread between informed and uninformed pricing is enormous.
