Understanding what drives card prices in Wonders of The First.

## The Price-Power Connection

Card prices in WoTF aren't random. They follow patterns based on:

1. **Competitive demand** - Do winning decks need this?
2. **Rarity math** - How many copies does each player need?
3. **Collectibility** - Art, first prints, condition
4. **Supply factors** - Print run, set age, reprints

Understanding these factors helps you buy smarter and sell at the right time.

## Rarity Economics

### Legendary (1 per deck)
**Demand pattern:** Every player who wants one needs exactly one.

- Lower raw demand than Primary/Secondary
- But supply is also lower
- Prices are volatile—spiking on hype, crashing on rotation
- Casual demand provides a floor

**Buy strategy:** Wait for post-hype dips. Legendaries spike on release, then settle.

**Sell strategy:** Sell into hype. Tournament results and content creator coverage create windows.

### Primary (2 per deck)
**Demand pattern:** Higher demand than Legendary, need 2 for a playset.

- Most consistent demand tier
- Staples hold value across meta shifts
- Archetype-specific cards swing with that deck's popularity

**Buy strategy:** Identify staples early. Primaries that go in multiple decks rarely drop.

**Sell strategy:** Hold staples. Sell archetype pieces when that deck dominates (peak demand).

### Secondary (3 per deck)
**Demand pattern:** Highest raw demand, but also highest supply.

- Only exceptional cards maintain value
- Most Secondaries settle to bulk prices
- Playsets are cheap to complete

**Buy strategy:** Don't chase Secondary cards. Wait—supply catches up.

**Sell strategy:** Sell immediately if you open something playable. Supply floods the market fast.

## Keyword Price Impacts

Keywords signal a card's role and demand profile.

### Premium Keywords (Add Value)

**Guardian**
- Stone protection is rare and powerful
- Guardians in key stats hold prices
- Even marginal Guardians maintain demand

**Ascend**
- Round 7 win conditions
- High variance in power level
- Strong Ascend = premium pricing

**Attuned**
- Action economy is universally useful
- Goes in any deck of that orbital
- Reliable demand floor

### High-Demand Keywords

**Flying**
- Aggressive decks always want this
- Consistent cross-archetype demand

**Seek**
- Card quality + tempo
- Scales with format's power level

**Shield**
- Defensive staple
- Protects investments (other expensive cards)

### Situational Keywords (Context-Dependent)

**Hoard**
- Only good in decks that expect to lead
- Price tied to those deck's meta share

**Kingdom**
- Requires land commitment
- Price tied to that orbital's competitive viability

**Symbiosis**
- High variance, skill-testing
- Competitive players pay more; casual less

### Link Keywords

**Orbital Link (Lands)**
- Price follows the orbital's overall power
- If Solfera becomes dominant, Solfera lands spike
- Best land investments: orbitals with strong Core cards

## Meta Cycles and Price Movement

### Pre-Tournament
- Speculation drives prices
- Untested cards spike on theory
- Risk: buying into unproven hype

### Post-Tournament
- Results create immediate movement
- Top 8 lists define staples
- Prices reflect actual demand

### Format Staple Establishment
- Prices stabilize around "known" good cards
- Safe buy window for proven cards
- Lower upside, lower risk

### New Set Release
- Old staples tested against new cards
- Potential for rotation-style crashes
- New archetypes can tank old ones

## Identifying Undervalued Cards

Cards are often underpriced when:

### 1. Complexity Discount
- Difficult to evaluate abilities
- Requires format knowledge to see potential
- Community hasn't "solved" the card

**Example:** Cards with multiple conditional triggers. People don't do the math.

### 2. Archetype Not Found Yet
- Synergy pieces without a home
- Waiting for one more enabler
- "Useless" until the deck exists

**Example:** Kingdom cards before enough lands exist.

### 3. Sleeper in Plain Sight
- Strong but boring effect
- No flashy ability to generate hype
- Solid efficiency overlooked

**Example:** Efficiently-statted Wonders without splashy text.

### 4. Post-Hype Crash
- Card was overhyped on release
- Price crashed below true value
- Good card at bad price

**Buy window:** 2-4 weeks post-release, after initial supply hits.

## Identifying Overvalued Cards

Cards are often overpriced when:

### 1. Hype Over Substance
- Content creator featuring it
- Cool art, cool name, cool ability text
- Actual performance unknown

**Sell signal:** Price spiked without tournament results backing it.

### 2. Win-More Syndrome
- Great when ahead, terrible from behind
- Tournament results won't match hype
- Hoard-style abilities often culprits

### 3. Fragile to Answers
- Expensive card with no protection
- Dies to common removal
- One-for-one trades hurt expensive cards more

### 4. Archetype Peak
- Deck is dominant NOW
- Meta will adjust
- Archetype pieces at ATH = sell signal

## The Supply Side

### Set Age Effects
- Older sets have depleted sealed product
- Cards get rarer over time if not reprinted
- "Old staple" premiums emerge

### Print Run Variations
- First printings command collector premiums
- Promo/alternate arts have separate demand curves
- Special editions can exceed regular prices significantly

### Reprint Risk
- Anticipate reprints for expensive staples
- Prices often crash 30-50% on reprint announcement
- Hold period matters—reprint timing unpredictable

## Collection Building vs. Speculation

### Collection Building
**Goal:** Own cards you'll play with.

- Buy playsets of staples (3x for Secondary, 2x for Primary, 1x for Legendary)
- Prioritize your primary orbital/archetype
- Quality over quantity
- Condition matters if you might sell later

### Speculation
**Goal:** Profit from price movement.

- Buy undervalued, sell into hype
- Focus on tournament timing
- Liquidity matters—can you actually sell?
- Small positions across many specs beat concentrated bets

### Hybrid Approach
Most players do both:
- Buy playset + 1-2 extras of likely staples
- Play with yours, sell extras if price spikes
- Reduces effective cost of collection

## Using WondersTracker for Market Intelligence

### Price History
- See what cards actually sell for (not just listings)
- Identify trends before they're obvious
- Compare across sellers/platforms

### Volume Indicators
- High volume = liquid market
- Low volume = price manipulation risk
- Volume spikes often precede price movement

### Collection Tracking
- Know your total value at any moment
- Identify which pieces to move
- Track ROI on purchases

### Deck Pricing
- Cost out a deck before buying in
- Compare to budget alternatives
- See where your money actually goes

## Practical Buying Guidelines

### When to Buy
- **Staples:** As soon as you need them. They rarely get cheaper.
- **Speculation:** Pre-tournament on educated guesses; post-crash on proven cards.
- **Collection:** When price is stable and you're ready to play.

### When to Sell
- **Hype peaks:** Card is being featured but hasn't proven itself.
- **Archetype peak:** Your deck is the best deck. Everyone wants these cards NOW.
- **Before rotation/reprint:** If you can anticipate it.

### When to Hold
- **Format staples:** They hold value unless something replaces them.
- **Playsets you use:** Transaction costs eat profits on small movements.
- **First prints/special editions:** Collector demand is independent of meta.

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Buying the spike** - If it already spiked, you're too late.
2. **Panic selling the crash** - Evaluate why it crashed. Sometimes it's a buy.
3. **Overpaying for FOMO** - Another tournament will happen. Another price window will open.
4. **Ignoring condition** - Damaged cards tank resale value.
5. **Speculating on Secondary** - Supply is too high. Margins are thin.
6. **Emotional attachment** - Cards are assets. Evaluate them as such.

## Summary: Thinking Like a Market Participant

1. **Know what drives demand** - Competitive, casual, collector. Different curves.
2. **Understand rarity math** - Legendary vs. Primary vs. Secondary economics.
3. **Watch the meta** - Tournament results move markets.
4. **Buy when others aren't looking** - Post-hype, pre-discovery.
5. **Sell into demand** - Hype peaks, archetype dominance.
6. **Track everything** - Data beats intuition.
