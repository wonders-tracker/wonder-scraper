A guide to understanding what makes cards valuable in Wonders of The First—for deckbuilding and market insight.

## The Two Types of Value

When evaluating WoTF cards, consider two perspectives:

1. **Gameplay Value**: How strong is this card in decks?
2. **Market Value**: How much demand exists for this card?

These overlap significantly—powerful cards are usually expensive—but not always. Collectibility, rarity, and art quality create gaps between raw power and price.

## Core Evaluation Factors

### 1. Efficiency (Cost vs. Impact)

The most fundamental question: **What do you get for what you pay?**

**Energy efficiency:**
- A 2-cost Wonder with 3 power is efficient
- A 5-cost Wonder with 4 power is inefficient
- Abilities can justify "inefficient" stat lines

**Action efficiency:**
- Attuned cards are inherently efficient (free action)
- Cards that generate extra actions or draw multiply value
- Cards requiring multiple actions to function are costly

**The benchmark:** Compare similar costs. A 3-drop should compete with other 3-drops.

### 2. Flexibility

Cards that do multiple things or work in multiple situations are more valuable.

**High flexibility:**
- Portal (repositioning + dodge removal)
- Flying (attack multiple realms)
- Seek (card selection + tempo)

**Low flexibility:**
- Narrow triggers (only useful in specific situations)
- Realm-locked effects
- Build-around cards that need support

Flexible cards go in more decks → higher demand → higher prices.

### 3. Inevitability

Some cards win games if left unchecked. These command premiums.

**Ascend abilities** represent pure inevitability—if you survive to round 7, you get a massive effect.

**Guardian** creates inevitability by making stones impossible to contest.

**Hoard** snowballs—the more you're winning, the stronger you get.

Cards that say "deal with me or lose" are always valuable.

### 4. Consistency

Reliable cards beat explosive-but-unreliable ones over many games.

**Consistent:**
- On Arrival triggers (happen once, guaranteed)
- Static abilities (always active)
- Self-sufficient cards (don't need other pieces)

**Inconsistent:**
- "When opponent does X" triggers
- Symbiosis (needs the right target)
- Kingdom (needs land support)

Competitive players prize consistency. Casual players accept variance for bigger highs.

## Card Type Analysis

### Wonders

The core of every deck. Evaluate by:

**Power-to-cost ratio:**
- Baseline: roughly 1 power per 1 energy
- Above baseline = premium stats
- Below baseline = ability should compensate

**Ability quality:**
- Does it help you win stones?
- Does it protect itself?
- Does it generate advantage?

**Timing:**
- Early (1-3 cost): Must be efficient or have strong abilities
- Mid (4-5 cost): Balance of stats and abilities
- Late (6+ cost): Must dominate or have game-ending potential

**Red flags:**
- High cost, low power, situational ability
- Requires setup that may not happen
- Dies to common removal without impact

### Lands

Often undervalued. Evaluate by:

**Link value:**
- How many good cards share this orbital?
- Are there strong Core cards to unlock?

**Harvest ability:**
- Extra actions = extremely powerful
- Extra energy = solid
- Card draw = strong
- Situational effects = weaker

**Meta consideration:** If an orbital becomes dominant, its lands spike in value.

### Items

The widest evaluation range. Questions to ask:

**Equipment:**
- How much does it boost stats?
- Does it add abilities?
- Does it protect the Wonder?
- How easy is it to equip (realm flexibility)?

**Non-equipment:**
- Is the ongoing effect worth a card slot?
- Does the activated ability justify the cost?
- Does it enable a strategy by itself?

**Equipment tends to be underrated** because it requires a Wonder to function—but the upside of stacking bonuses on one threat is huge.

### Spells

Hardest to evaluate because they're one-shots. Ask:

- Is the effect worth a card AND an action AND the energy?
- Could a Wonder accomplish something similar while also adding board presence?
- Is this effect unique (removal, mass buffs, etc.)?

**Strong spells:** Removal, mass effects, game-state reversals.

**Weak spells:** Narrow effects, overcosted for impact.

## Keyword Value Rankings

Not all keywords are equal. Here's a general hierarchy:

### Top Tier
- **Guardian**: Wins games by itself in the right realm
- **Ascend**: Free value for surviving
- **Attuned**: Action economy is king

### High Tier
- **Flying**: Multi-realm pressure
- **Seek**: Card quality + tempo
- **Shield**: Protection + trading up

### Mid Tier
- **Deathstrike**: Punishes losing, but you need to be winning
- **Stun**: Powerful effect, often attached to fragile bodies
- **Portal**: Flexible, but doesn't add power

### Situational Tier
- **Hoard**: Amazing when ahead, useless from behind
- **Kingdom**: Requires land commitment
- **Symbiosis**: High variance

### Context-Dependent
- **Link**: Depends entirely on the orbital's card pool
- **Harvest**: Depends on the specific effect

## Rarity and Market Dynamics

### Legendary Cards
- 1 per deck = concentrated demand
- Often splashy, build-around effects
- High price floors, but ceiling depends on playability

### Primary Cards
- 2 per deck = more demand than Secondary
- Often the "staples" of archetypes
- Playable Primaries hold value well

### Secondary Cards
- 3 per deck = highest raw demand
- But also highest supply
- Only the best maintain significant value

**Market insight:** Legendaries spike hardest on speculation, but playable Primaries have steadier demand.

## Evaluating for Different Formats

### Competitive Play
Prioritize:
- Consistency
- Efficiency
- Cards that function independently
- Answers to top strategies

### Casual Play
Prioritize:
- Exciting effects
- Synergy payoffs
- Splashy finishers
- Thematic coherence

### Collection/Investment
Prioritize:
- Playability across multiple archetypes
- Rarity
- Art quality and artist reputation
- First printings

## Spotting Undervalued Cards

Cards are often undervalued when:

1. **They require specific knowledge**: Complex triggers or unintuitive synergies
2. **The meta hasn't found them**: New archetypes emerge slowly
3. **They look bad on paper**: 0-power creatures, high-cost spells
4. **They need other cards to exist**: A card waiting for its partner

Cards are often overvalued when:

1. **They're flashy but inconsistent**: Big numbers, narrow triggers
2. **They win "win-more"**: Great when ahead, terrible from behind
3. **The hype exceeds testing**: Pre-release speculation
4. **They're answered too easily**: Expensive threats that die to cheap removal

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

When looking at any card, ask:

- What does this cost (energy + action)?
- What do I get immediately?
- What do I get over time?
- How many decks want this?
- What answers beat this?
- Is there a cheaper/better alternative?

## Connecting to Price Tracking
